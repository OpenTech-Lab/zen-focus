## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user wants to improve their focus and productivity by using timed work sessions with breaks. They visit the ZenFocus app, select a focus mode (like Pomodoro for studying), start a timer, work during the focus period, take breaks when prompted, and track their progress over time to build productive habits.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user visits the app for the first time, **When** they select "Study Mode", **Then** the timer should be set to 25 minutes with a 5-minute break interval
2. **Given** a timer is running, **When** the user clicks pause, **Then** the timer should stop and display remaining time
3. **Given** a focus session completes, **When** the timer reaches zero, **Then** the user should be notified and the break timer should start automatically
4. **Given** a user completes multiple sessions, **When** they view their history, **Then** they should see total focus time and session streaks
5. **Given** a user wants ambience, **When** they select ambient sounds, **Then** background audio should play during focus sessions
6. **Given** a user prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme, **Then** the entire interface should switch to dark colors

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user closes the browser during an active session?
- How does the system handle sessions that are paused for extended periods?
- What occurs if a user tries to start multiple sessions simultaneously?
- How does the app behave when ambient sounds fail to load?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide four distinct session modes: Study (25/5 min), Deep Work (50/10 min), Yoga (custom intervals), and Zen (open timer)
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to start, pause, and reset timers for any session mode
- **FR-003**: System MUST display visual progress indication during active timer sessions
- **FR-004**: System MUST automatically transition from work periods to break periods
- **FR-005**: System MUST notify users when timer periods complete
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to customize work and rest intervals for each mode
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide light and dark theme options
- **FR-008**: System MUST offer ambient sound options during sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST track and store session history for registered users
- **FR-010**: System MUST display user statistics including total focus time and session streaks
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to use the app without creating an account (guest mode)
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide user registration and authentication for data persistence
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain session state during page refreshes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should sessions persist across browser sessions?]
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle session data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period not specified]
- **FR-015**: System MUST support Yoga mode with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific breathing/pose interval structure not defined]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Session**: Represents a completed focus/work period with start time, duration, mode type, completion status
- **User**: Represents registered users with preferences, total focus time, streak counters, theme settings
- **Settings**: User preferences including preferred session durations, ambient sound choices, theme selection, notification preferences
- **SessionMode**: Defines the different types of focus sessions with default durations and characteristics
