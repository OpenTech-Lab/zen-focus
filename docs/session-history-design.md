# Session History Interface Design

## Overview

The Session History Interface is a comprehensive system for displaying, analyzing, and managing focus session data in the ZenFocus application. It provides users with detailed insights into their focus patterns, progress tracking, and actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Design System Integration

### Visual Design Language

The interface seamlessly integrates with the existing ZenFocus design system:

- **Color Palette**: Utilizes the established semantic color system
  - Primary (Emerald): Study mode and main actions
  - Secondary (Blue): Deep Work mode and data visualization
  - Accent (Violet): Yoga mode and highlights
  - Neutral (Gray): Zen mode and supporting elements

- **Typography**: Follows the established hierarchy
  - Inter font family for UI text
  - JetBrains Mono for timer displays and data
  - Consistent sizing scale (timer, timer-sm, etc.)

- **Component Consistency**:
  - Card-based layouts with rounded-xl borders
  - Gentle shadows and transitions
  - Consistent spacing using the established scale

### Component Architecture

```typescript
SessionHistoryInterface/
├── session-history-interface.tsx (Main interface)
├── session-chart.tsx (Data visualization)
├── session-insights.tsx (AI-powered insights)
└── index.ts (Export barrel)
```

## Interface Design Decisions

### 1. Information Hierarchy

**Primary Level**: Quick overview statistics
- Total sessions, focus time, completion rate, current streak
- Displayed as prominent cards for immediate recognition

**Secondary Level**: Detailed session list
- Expandable rows with core information visible
- Progressive disclosure for detailed session data

**Tertiary Level**: Advanced analytics
- Charts, trends, and AI-generated insights
- Separated into dedicated tabs for focused viewing

### 2. Layout Strategy

**Responsive Design**:
- Mobile-first approach with collapsible sections
- Grid layouts that adapt from single column to multi-column
- Touch-friendly controls with adequate spacing

**Content Organization**:
- Tabbed interface separating History and Statistics
- Filters grouped logically at the top
- Export functionality prominently placed but not intrusive

### 3. Data Presentation

**Session List Design**:
```typescript
// Each session row contains:
- Mode indicator (colored badge)
- Time and date information
- Duration and efficiency metrics
- Status badge (completed/incomplete)
- Expandable details section
```

**Visual Indicators**:
- Color-coded session modes matching existing design
- Progress bars for session efficiency
- Badge system for status and achievements
- Trend arrows for data direction

### 4. Interactive Features

**Filtering System**:
- Multi-dimensional filtering (time, mode, status, search)
- Clear visual feedback for applied filters
- Easy filter reset functionality

**Sorting Options**:
- Multiple sort criteria (date, duration, mode)
- Visual sort direction indicators

## Data Visualization Strategy

### Chart Design Philosophy

**Simplicity First**:
- Custom SVG-based charts for precise control
- Minimal visual elements to reduce cognitive load
- Focus on data story rather than decoration

**Color Usage**:
- Semantic colors matching session modes
- Accessibility-friendly color combinations
- Consistent color meaning across all visualizations

**Interaction Design**:
- Hover states for additional information
- Tooltip-style details on demand
- Smooth transitions and animations

### Chart Types

**Bar Charts**: Weekly/monthly activity visualization
